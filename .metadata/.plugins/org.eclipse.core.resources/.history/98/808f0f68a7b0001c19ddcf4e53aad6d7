@Register map
@R0 - points, returns class
@R1 - centroids
@R2 - classifications
@R3 - point x-position
@R4 - point y-position
@R5 - centroid x-position
@R6 - centroid y-position
@R7 - distance to centroid 0
@R8 -
@....

classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R8,R14}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here
loop:	LDR R3, [R0], #4 @load point x-pos into R3
		LDR R4, [R0], #4 @load point y-pos into R4
		LDR R5, [R1] @load centroid 0 x-pos into R5
		LDR R6, [R1, #4] @load centroid 0 x-pos into R6

		SUB R5, R3 @calculate difference in x-pos
		SUB R6, R4 @calculate difference in y-pos
		MUL	R5, R5 @calculate squared x distance
		MUL	R6, R6 @calculate squared y distance

		ADD R7, R5, R6

@ branch to SUBROUTINE for illustration only

@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
@ return value
		MOV R0, R7
@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
		POP {R1-R8,R14}
@ return to C program
		BX	LR

@label: .word value

@.lcomm label num_bytes
